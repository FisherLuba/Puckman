# Puckman
##useless discord bot
###like, completely useless

commands include:
- /howtall: tells you how tall a server member is. Gets heights from a google sheet using the google sheets API
- /rule: boring. Used to edit rules, which determine whether the bot does certain things.
- /set_welcome_message: used to set a message that sends when someone new joins the server
- /roulette: play a game of chance, except the chances are all 0%. Stolen from a friend who's working on a real discord bot that isn't a joke. They do not know I did this.
- /random_server_member: picks a random server member and a random delay between 0 seconds and 4 hours, then ghost pings them after the delay

Puckman is designed to work on only one server.
he is not particularly useful.
